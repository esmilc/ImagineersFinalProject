1. For all of the rides, the wait timas are for the month of March 2023. 
2. We are going to make this application for someone who's going to travel in March, the busiest month for Disney
3. USER WILL BE GIVEN 6 MINUTES BETWEEN RIDES
4. It's a small world is formatted weird on the CSV file

MINHEAP:
    we could possibly use a minheap
    minHeap is organized by start time, but if 2 are equal chooses the one with lowest wait time
    my implementation could be considered a greedy algorithm
    

Features to [POSSIBLY] add:
    - Ask for a time of arrival at park
        -Ask for departure time???
    -Maybe user validation when user inputs what date, i check if its length 2 but not if theyre both numbers
